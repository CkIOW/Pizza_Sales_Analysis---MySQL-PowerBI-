# Pizza Sales Analysis üìàüìä

üìçWelcome to the Pizza Sales Analysis project! This repository contains the code and data used to analyze pizza sales data, extracted from a MySQL database, and visualize insights using Power BI.

## Overview

üíªPizza Sales Analysis project aims to provide meaningful insights into pizza sales data to understand sales performance, daily and monthly trends, and key performance indicators (KPIs) of the business.

## Data Extraction and Preparation

- The data was extracted from the source system and stored in a MySQL database for analysis.
- We performed data preparation tasks, including altering the table structure to change specific data types and ensure compatibility for analysis.

## Data Analysis

- Utilizing SQL queries, we retrieved and analyzed the data to identify key insights such as:
  - Sales performance metrics, including revenue, quantity sold, and average order value.
  - Daily and monthly sales trends to understand seasonal variations and peak periods.
  - Identification of best-selling and worst-selling pizza items based on sales volume.
  
## Power BI Integration

- The cleaned and prepared dataset was integrated with Power BI for visualization and dashboard creation.
- Power BI was used to develop interactive dashboards that allow users to explore sales data dynamically.
- DAX queries were employed to create additional measures and calculations to enhance the dashboard's analytical capabilities.
